# ProcessingProjects
A compilation of projects used as a student resource to demonstrate both interactive and artistic applications of code to beginner programmers in intro to CS classes.

```These files were written in java but can be adapted to pyhton. Both basic implementations of the projects are meant to be completed within the 30 minutes of in-class work time ```

## Pong
This is a simple implementation of Pong that could be written by students in less than the 30 minute class requirement. It has a very basic score tracking and collision system. Based off of the Processing Bounce example.

## Orbit

This example shows how to use the draw() function to create movement in processing. Comes with two examples for the simple orbiting functionality and a more complex multi-body orbiting example that has to account for when the different bodies are drawn. This can be expanded on by students to create render priorities based on body "distance" from the viewport.
